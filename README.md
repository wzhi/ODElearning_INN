# ODElearning_INN
[ICML 2022] Learning Efficient and Robust Ordinary Differential \\ Equations via Invertible Neural Networks

Code requires Torch, Torchdiffeq (for neural ODEs), FrEIA (for invertible NNs), and for the latent ODE problems, borrows heavily from code from the original Latent ODE work.
To understand the method, it is recommended to start by looking at the code in "systems".
Code has yet to be refactored for clarity and readability -- this is coming soon.
